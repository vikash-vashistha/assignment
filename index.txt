Write a post API which modifies the product database based on the given payload.

Suppose you have 10 products with specific quantities in your inventory collection. You have to design an API that accepts multiple productIds and add and remove the quantities from inventory from the SKUs upon successful API call.

Also, please design the schema for the inventory collection and establish a connection with mongodb server running locally or on atlas

Sample POST API call

payload=

[{productId:123,quantity:10,operation:”add”},

{productId:143,quantity:14,operation:”add”},

{productId:193,quantity:17,operation:”subtract”}]




Please note-
Multiple products can be sent in one API call
Create 2 files, one for schema and one for API route
tech stack should be only express and MongoDB
